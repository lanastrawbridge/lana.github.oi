            During this week's class, we focused on the concept of user personas and the process of creating them. We delved into the significance of understanding the various personas we might consider when designing a website. A valuable insight that emerged from our discussions was the idea that it might be more effective to envision the website we want to create before crafting a corresponding user persona. This shift in perspective allows me to tailor personas to the specific needs and goals of the website.

            In our workshop, we put this approach into practice by coming up with a fictional character representing a larger target demographic. While most of my classmates chose to create personas for elderly individuals with limited technical skills during our user persona workshop, I took a different route. I opted to design a user persona for a younger, tech-savvy individual. This choice offers an interesting perspective, as younger audiences tend to prioritize the aesthetics of a website, aiming to make their online experience more enjoyable. In contrast, for an older target audience, website functionality and ease of navigation may take precedence over visual design.

            In regards to the first assignment, I decided I wanted to design a website catering to individuals in my own age group 18-25 looking for a new rental property. I decided in class, after brainstorming a few ideas that I would make a rental property searching website, addressing a need that I, as a member of this demographic, would find extremely valuable. There are existing rental searching platforms such as Trademe or OneRoof, however, they are hard to navigate and poorly designed.

        <p style="max-width: 900px;">
            In summary, this week's class emphasized the importance of aligning personas with the website's objectives and crafting comprehensive, well-researched character profiles. This approach ensures that our design work remains user-centered so that when we get to making a website, we know the exact wants and needs, expectations, and limitations of our user target.
