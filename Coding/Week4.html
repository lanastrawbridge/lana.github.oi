            This week's class revolved around Assignment 1, where we re-covered essential components to include in our hand-ins. First and foremost, we tackled the creation of User Personas, (see mine pictured below) a crucial step in which we define a representative user archetype, detailing their desires, needs, and pain points. We then covered Venn Diagrams as a graphical tool to illustrate the relationship between users and web designers, guiding the development of website content and features that cater to shared interests. Another key concept we discussed was the User Journey, a visual representation of a user's step-by-step interactions, emotions, and expectations when navigating a website. This journey mapping allows designers to pinpoint areas of confusion and opportunities for improvement in user interactions. Additionally, we learned about User Flow Maps. We also delved into the structuring of the assignment for a stress-free submission, APA 7th edition referencing, and how we should specify any usage of AI in the assignment. For the final hand-in, itâ€™s expected that we consolidate all materials into a single PDF document for streamlined assessment.
