            This week, our class discussions began with a review of the submission process for our recent assignments. We then delved into a workshop activity where we collaborated in groups to redesign the Candle website, which we had previously critiqued in earlier sessions. We compared the original website design to our own and made specific improvements. Our group made the prices and product names more prominent and centrally aligned within their respective boxes. I think the light pink and green icons in the navigation bar do not stand out well against the white background. Another group member made this choice, which I didn't fully support. The photos also show that the CandleLeaf logo was too faint on the white background. On the positive side, I really liked the pink section of our website, and I believe we could have improved the overall look by changing the webpage's colour and removing the mint green

                The workshop provided an insightful experience reinforcing the idea that web design requires attention to detail and adherence to design principles for a successful outcome and sometimes, stepping away from a project and returning to it with fresh eyes is necessary to identify what may be wrong with it. Through this experience, I gained a better understanding of aesthetic principles and the importance of clarity, simplicity, and minimal cognitive load in web design, all crucial for ensuring user-friendliness for individuals of varying abilities, including those unfamiliar with the website.

            Another group in the class enlarged their image of the candles and overlaid the text on top to create an appealing design.
