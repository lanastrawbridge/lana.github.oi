            During this tutorial session, our primary focus was on Assignment 2.1 and the tasks to be accomplished during the teaching break, as well as the preparations required before our first class post-break. Additionally, we engaged in a practical exercise involving a website example in Figma, where we practised identifying errors to help us avoid similar mistakes in our own website design projects.

                Below is an image of the website we analysed. I found this exercise highly valuable as it allowed for a meticulous breakdown and in-depth analysis of various website elements. It underscored the importance of consistency in web design, emphasising the need for uniformity in fonts, sizes, and colours across different web pages. The exercise also shed light on the significance of colour choices, emphasising that light-coloured buttons must avoid having white text to ensure a strong contrast between the background and text for readability. These critical insights will certainly guide my approach as I work on Assignment 2.1, where I'll be creating wireframes for my chosen website from Assignment 1, which in my case is the FlatFindr website.
