            In this week's class, our main emphasis was on the final preparations for Assignment 1, which is due at 9:30 am on Tuesday, August 15th. We dedicated most of this time to refining our assignments to ensure they meet the specified criteria for submission. Last week, I had already worked on creating my user flow diagrams and a user journey map as part of my assignment. Alongside this assignment focus, we delved into our site of the week, Surfe, which left a notable impression due to its captivating use of colours, engaging illustrations, and animations. The website's unique scrolling experience also stood out as a noteworthy feature.

                In preparation for the assignment hand-in, we were reminded to include the following in our PDF submission: the assignment content itself, a reference page, and a documentation page for any AI components used in our work. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to receive valuable one-on-one feedback, aimed at enhancing the quality and effectiveness of my Assignment 1 submission.

                    For this assignment, my objective was to create a user persona tailored to a student searching for a new rental property. I chose the platform "FlatFindr" to design a user-centric website, which allows users to effortlessly browse and explore flats that align with their unique requirements and preferences, all while delivering an aesthetically pleasing web experience.
