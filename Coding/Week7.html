            During our class, we explored a range of strategies for refining our website prototypes for ur hand in. These strategies included utilising grids to enhance the visual appeal and organise content for easy user scanning. We also delved into the establishment of a clear visual hierarchy to draw users' attention to essential content for quick identification. Additionally, we discussed the significance of colour choices in creating an aesthetic identity that improves readability and contributes to a positive user experience. The concept of scale was explored as a means to emphasise key content and guide users through web pages effectively. Moreover, we examined the use of white space, or negative space, as a tool to enhance readability and reduce visual clutter, thereby making content more digestible. Balancing the layout was also emphasised to create a harmonious and user-friendly navigation experience. Furthermore, we delved into the importance of aligning our designs with user mental models, which helps in reducing cognitive load. We also delved into the concept of affordances, highlighting how visible cues guide user actions and interactions on a website.

                In designing my FlatFindr website, where a wealth of rental property information needs to be presented to users, my primary objective for a successful webpage is to prioritise the delivery of the most vital information. To achieve this, the homepage of my FlatFindr website will prominently feature a search filter, enabling users to initiate property searches based on their specific criteria right from the moment they arrive on the site. Placing the search filter at the forefront of the website is crucial since it aligns with users' immediate needs and intentions when visiting the site. This approach ensures that users can quickly access the essential functionality of the website, creating a user-friendly and efficient experience from the very beginning.

                    To alleviate visual overload, I plan to employ a variety of techniques. Firstly, I'll leverage images over text where possible, as visuals can convey information more efficiently and engage users effectively. Additionally, I'll implement drop-down buttons and "see more" options for text content when appropriate. These interactive elements allow users to access additional information on demand, ensuring that they can explore details at their own pace without overwhelming the initial view. By incorporating these techniques, I aim to streamline the user experience and make the webpage more digestible and user-friendly.
