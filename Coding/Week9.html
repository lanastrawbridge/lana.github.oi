            This week, our primary focus revolved around the CMS assignment still. In our discussions, we looked at the importance of thorough project documentation, ensuring transparency in the decision-making process behind every aspect of our work. In regards to the next assignment which will be coding my own blog from scratch, it is important to keep in mind that effective file organisation is very important, and it is best to structure files in a manner that facilitates long-term maintenance and can be easily updated. This involves nesting different elements within the same folders and adhering to a consistent naming system. 

            We also looked at Tiny PNG as a valuable resource for optimising image files. While I hadn't initiated my CMS project yet, after our class session, I promptly commenced work on my CMS using Editor X.        <p style="max-width: 900px;">
