            In this week's tutorial, our primary focus was on the CMS assignment hand-in, and we also delved into the preparations for the blog hand-in, particularly for those who will be coding their blogs. During our discussion, we received valuable advice to prioritise simplicity when creating our blogs. It was emphasised that starting with a simple design allows for easier enhancements in terms of appearance, colour, and aesthetics.
            As of now, I've successfully completed the main page for my assignment hand-in, and I feel on track with my progress. I've also developed a better understanding of using Editor X compared to the beginning of the week, although I acknowledge that it can be somewhat challenging and intricate to navigate.
            Looking ahead, once I submit my CMS work, I'll be transitioning directly into the coding phase for my blog, where I plan to incorporate all my journal entries from this trimester. Overall, this trimester has been highly beneficial for my learning journey. I've significantly improved my skills in using Figma for wire-framing, especially when compared to my earlier attempts of wire-framing, earlier in the year. Furthermore, I believe I'm developing a keener eye for detail and a deeper understanding of what users prioritise when interacting with web pages.        <p style="max-width: 900px;">
